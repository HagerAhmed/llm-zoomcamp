RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question by providing a recommendation based on the provided context. It explains the workaround of manually adding model files when they are not built automatically and also highlights the potential issues with this approach. Finally, it suggests a best practice of including all necessary model files in the Dockerfile."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer discusses the importance of considering any feature that offers additional predictive value and the significance of evaluating feature impact on model performance. However, it does not directly address the 'always best' aspect of training a model only on the most important features. The answer is partly relevant because it provides context about feature selection and model performance but does not fully answer the question as posed."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer does mention the example regarding feature importance for categorical values in lesson, but it does not provide a clear explanation of how the method works in practice or address its limitations."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer does discuss the importance of including features that contribute to performance, but it does not directly address the question about excluding features that minimally contribute. However, it does mention that dropping some features might be fine if they are highly correlated with others, which could be interpreted as excluding minimally contributing features. Therefore, the answer is partly relevant."
RELEVANT,The generated answer accurately describes L1 regularization (Lasso) as a method that implicitly performs feature selection by shrinking some weights to zero. This is relevant to the question asked.
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the question as it discusses the possibility of dropping highly correlated features without affecting model performance, which was asked in the question. It also provides methods for identifying correlated features and suggests evaluating the model's performance after removing them. The answer could be more partly relevant if it directly addressed whether important features are highly correlated with others, but it is still essentially covering the topic of the question."
