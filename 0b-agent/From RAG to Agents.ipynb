      "\n",
      "### **Limitations to Keep in Mind**\n",
      "- **No Real-Time Data**: ChatGPT’s knowledge cutoff is 2023 (for GPT-4), so it may not know recent events.\n",
      "- **Not Always Accurate**: Verify critical information from reliable sources.\n",
      "- **No Personal Opinions**: It doesn’t have personal experiences or emotions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Would you like help with something specific? 😊\n"

      "Having this local repository on your computer will make it easy for you to access the instructors’ code and make pull requests (if you want to add your own notes or make changes to the course content).\n",
      "You will probably also create your own repositories that host your notes, versions of your file, to do this. Here is a great tutorial that shows you how to do this: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository\n",
      "Remember to ignore large database, .csv, and .gz files, and other files that should not be saved to a repository. Use .gitignore for this: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/gitignore NEVER store passwords or keys in a git repo (even if that repo is set to private).\n",

      "question: Course - Can I follow the course after it finishes?\n",
      "answer: Yes, we will keep all the materials after the course finishes, so you can follow the course at your own pace after it finishes.\n",
      "You can also continue looking at the homeworks and continue preparing for the next cohort. I guess you can also start working on your final capstone project.\n",

      "question: Certificate - Can I follow the course in a self-paced mode and get a certificate?\n",
      "answer: No, you can only get a certificate if you finish the course with a “live” cohort. We don't award certificates for the self-paced mode. The reason is you need to peer-review capstone(s) after submitting a project. You can only peer-review projects at the time the course is running.\n",

      "section: General course-related questions\n",
      "question: Is it possible to use tool “X” instead of the one tool you use in the course?\n",
      "answer: Yes, this applies if you want to use Airflow or Prefect instead of Mage, AWS or Snowflake instead of GCP products or Tableau instead of Metabase or Google data studio.\n",
      "The course covers 2 alternative data stacks, one using GCP and one using local installation of everything. You can use one of them or use your tool of choice.\n",
      "Should you consider it instead of the one tool you use? That we can’t support you if you choose to use a different stack, also you would need to explain the different choices of tool for the peer review of your capstone project.\n",

      "question: How do I use Git / GitHub for this course?\n",
      "answer: After you create a GitHub account, you should clone the course repo to your local machine using the process outlined in this video: Git for Everybody: How to Clone a Repository from GitHub\n",
      "Having this local repository on your computer will make it easy for you to access the instructors’ code and make pull requests (if you want to add your own notes or make changes to the course content).\n",
      "You will probably also create your own repositories that host your notes, versions of your file, to do this. Here is a great tutorial that shows you how to do this: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository\n",
      "Remember to ignore large database, .csv, and .gz files, and other files that should not be saved to a repository. Use .gitignore for this: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/gitignore NEVER store passwords or keys in a git repo (even if that repo is set to private).\n",
